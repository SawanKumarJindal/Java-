false  // It will concatenate "1.	xyz == aString:	" +     "xyz" into each other and then it will check whether its concatenated result is equal to aString which is not equal..
2.	xyz == aString:	true   // Firstly it will just print the data in the double chords and then it will check whether "xyz" is equal to aString which is true..
xyz == new String(xyz)    //  Similarly to the previous line it will print the data in the double chords and in the end it has \n thus the controller or pointer will move to the next line...
	false  //  it will check the condition but it will return false as the first one is literal string and the next one is an object String..

	true  // it is printing true when it checks the statement ( literal == aNewString ). Both have the same value "xyz"....
2 in method  //  method will call the main method with three arguments and print out the id first which is 2 and then will print in method....

	true  // it will return true as the literal has the value "xyz" and aNewString has the value "xyz" as well after concatenating xy with z...

	literal= aNewString  //  the cursor will go the \t which gives tab space and then prints the line and then reads \n which takes the cursor to the nextline...
	false  // it wont have the same value as the concatination of x and y will take place as usual but concatenating a literal string with object string wont return "xyz"...

	literal= aNewString  //  the cursor will go the \t which gives tab space and then prints the line and then reads \n which takes the cursor to the nextline...
	true  //  Firstly it will concatenate y and z and then the result will concatenate with x which is similar to "xyz"...

	literal= aNewString  //  the cursor will go the \t which gives tab space and then prints the line and then reads \n which takes the cursor to the nextline...
	true  //  java will implicitly convert char x into string x and then firstly it will concatenate y and z and then with the implicitly converted x and then after checking it will return true...
